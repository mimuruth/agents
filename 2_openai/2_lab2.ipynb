    "*   **Ranker/selector:** a separate sales\\_picker agent chooses the single best draft from the ensemble.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "*   **Tool use / function calling:** @function\\_tool wraps send\\_email (and later send\\_html\\_email) so agents can call real actions.\n",
    "    \n",

    "*   **Personalizer agent:** given a prospect record (name, company, ICP fit, last news), returns line-level personalization to prepend to the chosen draft.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*   **Safety/review tool:** checks for compliance/PII/claims; blocks send if risky.\n",
